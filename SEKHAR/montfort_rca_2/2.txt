Rajesh and Pranay enjoy doing social work. They like to help their friends and the community. One day, they saw their neighbour, Mrs. Sushila, struggling to carry heavy bags of groceries. They rushed to help her. They carried the bags to her door and saw her smile. Mrs. Sushila was very happy for their help. They both felt happy, too.
Sometimes, they involve in cleaning up the neighbourhood or visit a nearby old age home to talk to the elder people. Social work is about being kind and making the world a better place. They believe that helping others is a great way to spread happiness.
