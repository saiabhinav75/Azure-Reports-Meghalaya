My favorite season is winter. In the winter, the nights are long and cool. The weather remains cool and the temperature remains low during the winter. It begins in November and ends in February. It is the season of mist and fog.
New vegetables and fruits also arrive with winter. Pomegranate is my personal favorite. People prefer to wear clothing that keeps them warm, such as jackets, sweaters, and coats. People would rather stay at home, wrapped in warm blankets, than go out.
It also tends to snow in these months. Children like to play with snow and build snowmen. During my winter vacation, I also enjoy going on picnics with my family. I love winter the most out of all the other seasons.
