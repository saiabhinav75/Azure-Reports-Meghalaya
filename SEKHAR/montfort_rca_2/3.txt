Our human body is amazing. It's like a big puzzle with many pieces that fit together perfectly. We have a head on top, where our eyes, nose, and mouth are. Our arms and hands help us pick things up and give hugs. Our legs and feet help us walk and run. Inside our body, our heart beats to keep us alive, and our lungs help us breathe. We also have a tummy where our food goes, and it turns it into energy. Our skin keeps everything safe and warm. So, our human body is like a magical machine that lets us do all the fun things we love.
