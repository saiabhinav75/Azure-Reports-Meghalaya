The water cycle is an amazing process that keeps our planet's water flowing. Water from rivers, lakes, and oceans evaporates into the sky when the sun is hot. It forms clouds high in the sky, and when these clouds get heavy, they release water droplets as rain or snow. This water falls back to the ground and fills up our rivers and lakes, starting the cycle all over again. It's like nature's way of recycling water so that we always have enough to drink and for plants to grow.
