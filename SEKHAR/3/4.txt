Jack went on a trip with his backpack on a train sitting in the chair car. He also carried a first-aid kit. He had a pair of gum boots. He reached the top of the hill using the stairs. It started to rain suddenly. He saw some large snails and collected them in a pail. He claimed to have a great day. He spent some time there and returned home in the evening.
